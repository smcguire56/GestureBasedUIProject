# Gesture Based UI Project
## Myo Drag Racing

This is a project for GMIT's Gesture Based UI Module. This is a drag racing game built for the Myo Armband using Unity. The aim of the game is to beat the opponent AI in crossing the finish line by changing the gear and applying the boost mechanic at the right times. In this project I have included a video of a demonstration on how it works.
